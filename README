Rerun is an Apache 2 or later licensed utility.  Many files distributed in
the rerun distribution are generated by autoconf which are GPL v3 or later.
These GPL files are a dependency on the build system and are independent
works.

Since this is a github project and an autoconf project, the
README file is not used, README.md is the file to READ!

You'll probably have to install automake/automconf ("yum install automake" in a CentOS/Red Hat box).
When you checkout the file, run "setup.sh" which gets autoconf initialized.
Then follow the instructions in INSTALL.  Real standard stuff...
